Absolutely — here’s a tight, interview-ready SQL cheat list tuned specifically for Netflix + Device Reliability. This is the stuff to practice until it’s muscle memory.

Save this. Skim it right before the interview. 🧠🔥

🎯 Netflix SQL Interview Cheat List

(Device Reliability Focus)

1️⃣ First 60 Seconds: How Netflix Wants You to Think

Before typing SQL, say (or think):

“Is this isolated or systemic? What’s the user impact? What changed?”

That framing alone scores points.

2️⃣ Core Tables You Should Assume Exist

Practice queries assuming tables like:

playback_events(session_id, device_id, event_type, event_time, app_version)

device_sessions(session_id, device_type, device_model, os_version, country)

errors(session_id, error_code, event_time)

crashes(device_id, crash_time)

rollouts(app_version, rollout_date)

devices(device_id, manufacturer, model)

3️⃣ Must-Have Query Patterns (Practice These)
A️⃣ Failure Rate (Not Raw Count)
SELECT
  device_model,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'failure' THEN 1 END) * 1.0
    / COUNT(*) AS failure_rate
FROM playback_events
GROUP BY device_model
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1000
ORDER BY failure_rate DESC;


📌 Netflix loves rates + sample size filters.

B️⃣ Before vs After (Regression Check)
SELECT
  device_model,
  DATE(event_time) AS day,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'failure' THEN 1 END) * 1.0
    / COUNT(*) AS failure_rate
FROM playback_events
WHERE event_time >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '14 days'
GROUP BY device_model, DATE(event_time)
ORDER BY device_model, day;


📌 Look for step changes, not noise.

C️⃣ Device Cohort Isolation
SELECT
  device_type,
  os_version,
  COUNT(*) AS sessions
FROM device_sessions
GROUP BY device_type, os_version
ORDER BY sessions DESC;


📌 Helps explain why a problem is visible.

D️⃣ App Version Correlation
SELECT
  app_version,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN event_type = 'failure' THEN 1 END) * 1.0
    / COUNT(*) AS failure_rate
FROM playback_events
GROUP BY app_version
ORDER BY app_version;


📌 Always ask: rollout or coincidence?

E️⃣ Join Events → Devices
SELECT
  d.manufacturer,
  d.model,
  COUNT(*) AS failures
FROM playback_events p
JOIN devices d ON p.device_id = d.device_id
WHERE p.event_type = 'failure'
GROUP BY d.manufacturer, d.model
ORDER BY failures DESC;


📌 Shows cross-table reasoning.

F️⃣ Time to Detect (Advanced but Impressive)
SELECT
  device_model,
  MIN(event_time) AS first_failure_time
FROM playback_events
WHERE event_type = 'failure'
GROUP BY device_model;


📌 Reliability ≠ just fixing — detecting early matters.

G️⃣ Long-Tail Detection
SELECT
  device_model,
  COUNT(*) AS sessions
FROM device_sessions
GROUP BY device_model
HAVING COUNT(*) < 100
ORDER BY sessions;


📌 Netflix cares about long-tail devices.

4️⃣ Window Functions (Bonus Points)
Detect Sudden Spikes
SELECT
  device_model,
  day,
  failure_rate,
  failure_rate
    - LAG(failure_rate) OVER (PARTITION BY device_model ORDER BY day)
    AS delta
FROM daily_failure_rates;


📌 Signals regression detection skill.

5️⃣ Things to Say While Querying (Memorize These)

Use these exact phrases:

“I want to normalize by sessions to avoid volume bias.”

“I’ll slice by device cohort to isolate impact.”

“This looks correlated with rollout timing.”

“Sample size here is small, so I’d be cautious.”

“Next, I’d check OS or firmware skew.”

These are Netflix culture signals.

6️⃣ What NOT to Do

❌ One giant unreadable query
❌ Global averages only
❌ No explanation of why
❌ Ignoring rollout timing
❌ Treating metrics as absolute truth

7️⃣ How to End Every Answer (CRITICAL)

Always conclude with action:

“Based on this, I’d pause rollout for affected cohorts and add targeted monitoring before proceeding.”

Netflix wants decisions, not dashboards.

🧠 One-Page Mental Model

Repeat this internally:

Slice → Normalize → Compare → Explain → Decide

🚀 15-Minute Daily Practice Plan

5 min: failure rate + cohort query

5 min: before/after regression query

5 min: explain results out loud

Do this for 3–4 days and you’ll sound very senior.

If you want next, I can:

Run a mock SQL interview (I ask, you query + explain)

Give you Netflix-style messy data to clean

Translate QuickSet device bugs → SQL investigations

Just say which one 👌
